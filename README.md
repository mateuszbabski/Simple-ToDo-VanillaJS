# Vanilla JS Todo List project

Simple Todo List done using basics of HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

It took me way too long, but finally it works.

Functionality:

- adding tasks
- marking them as a 'done'
- editing task name
- deleting task
- deleting all tasks in one click

UI is horrible and not RWD
